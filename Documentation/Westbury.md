# Westbury

Westbury is a small junction station on the Great Western Main Line between London and Cornwall. Most long distance services don't actually stop at Westbury, using the avoiding lines instead, however there are plenty of local and regional services through the station to keep a signaller occupied. This simulation also includes Frome (also on a loop from the main line), and the line out to Castle Cary, where the Heart of Wessex Line diverges towards Yeovil and Weymouth.

## Simulation

The timetable included represents a Wednesday in March 2023, running from 04:20 until about 03:30 then next morning, with the following standard off peak services:

- 1tph London Paddington to Plymouth (avoiding Westbury) (GWR)
- 1tp2h London Paddington to Plymouth (calling at Westbury) (GWR)
- 1tph Portsmouth Harbour to Cardiff Central (GWR)
- 1tp2h Swindon to Westbury (GWR)
- 1tp2h Gloucester to Weymouth (GWR)
- Irregular London Waterloo to Yeovil Pen Mill (SWR)

There are additional peak services to various destinations, as well as a variety of freight services to the quarries in the area.

## Operational Tips

- Keep an eye on the platform allocations given in the description of each train for Westbury - if you stick to these everything should work.
- Its a good idea to set points for the route you want before actually setting the route - this is due to the amount of bi-directional track, and helps avoid blocking up the throats to the larger stations by mistake.
